##Trivia Night!

-----------------------------------
To run the program in your local environment:

- **git clone** the URL to your local machine;
- **npm install**
- The frontend of the program is built with React. The backend runs on a Node/Express server.
- **npm run start** to start the front end
- **npm run server** to start the back end
Both the front- and backend must be run simultaneously

--------------------------------------
Points of Improvement:
- Further styling to improve UI and fit a11y standards better
- Editing the proxy server so that the node server and React frontend can be run simultaneously with one command
